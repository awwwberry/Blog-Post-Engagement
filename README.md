## Introduction to My Project <a name="introduction"></a>
Hacker News has user-submitted stories that are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles.

The goal of this project is to explore posts submitted to Hacker News to see which features make the article more popular. Specifically if articles submitted to ASK HN or SHOW HN receive more comments than other categories. Also, if publishing an article as a certain times generates more engagement in comments. 

This is a guided project by [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) where I practice the basics of data analysis. 

## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>
Hacker News [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) with approximately 20,000 data points of stories submitted in 2016. 

## Languages <a name="languages"></a>
